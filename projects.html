This robot is designed to mow grass autonmously. The robot has 2 cameras, GPS, Gyros, Acceleoreometrs, Raspberry PÄ° 3, 12W solar panel 
Arduino Mega 2560 , 3 Dc motors for locomotion and cutter blade. <br> <br>
With the two frontal webcams, robot is able to detect grass area, and unmowed grasses. Also this two webcams used for an obstacle avoidance 
algorithm. The upper camera detects area with the grass and obstacles that are needed to be avoid. <br><br>
With GPS the robot avoids replication of same positions. Thus the operation of mowing grass, is done with optimal efficiency. <br><br>
Computer vision algorithms are developed in Python and OpenCV and Embedded to Raspberry Pi.  Since the computation power of Raspberry Pi
is relatively limited the algorithms were not performed optimally. <br><br>
At bottom left picture, the computer vision algorithm has deteceted intersted area , also the obstactle front of robot. The red line is 
meant to be optimal steering angle for the navigation. At bottom right picture GPS data is processed to an image, processed areas 
are circled in red line this indicated that the robot shall not pass through this area. This is done by comparing the most recent 
data from GPS with the scanned area.<br>

<h3 align="center" > Autonomous Aerial Vehicle's Simulation under Matlab Simulink </h3>

The equations of motion Borrowed from <a href="http://uavbook.byu.edu/doku.php ">here</a>  for the unmanned fixed wing aerial vehicle. The short video below shows real
time simulation of UAV. Kalman filter was also implemented to estimation of states. The Controller of Uav is diveded to lateral and 
longitidual controller to avoid complexity.
