This robot is designed to mow grass autonmously. The robot has 2 cameras, GPS, Gyros, Acceleoreometrs, Raspberry PÄ° 3, 12W solar panel 
Arduino Mega 2560 , 3 Dc motors for locomotion and cutter blade. <br>
With the two frontal webcams, robot is able to detect grass area, and unmowed grasses. Also this two webcams used for an obstacle avoidance 
algorithm. The upper camera detects area with the grass and obstacles that are needed to be avoid. <br>
With GPS the robot avoids replication of same positions. Thus the operation of mowing grass, is done with optimal efficiency. <br>
Computer vision algorithms are developed in Python and OpenCV and Embedded to Raspberry Pi.  Since the computation power of Raspberry Pi
is relatively limited the algorithms were not performed optimally.
