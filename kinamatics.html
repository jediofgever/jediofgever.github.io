<h4>Homogenous Transformation</h4>
with homogenous transformation, position vectors and rotation vectors are well combined in a in a compact notation<br>
any vector expressed relative to moving frame can be expressed relative to fixed frame<br>

<h4>Forward Kinematics</h4>
The forward kinematics problem for a serial-chain manipulator is to find the position and orientation of the<br>
end-effector relative to the base given the positions of all of the joints and the values of all of the geometric<br>
link parameters.

<h4>Inverse Kinematics</h4>
The inverse kinematics problem for a serial-chain manipulator is to find the values of the joint positions given <br>
the position and orientation of the end-effector relative to the base and the values of all of the geometric link <br>
parameters. Once again, this is a simplified statement applying only to serial chains.
