<h1>My Notes</h1>
<h4>What is A dynamic system ?</h4>
A dynamic system is one whose response variables are functions of time, with non-negligible “rates” of changes. Also, its present
output depends not only on the present input, but also on some historical information
(e.g., previous input or output)

<h4>An analytical model ?</h4>
An analytical model (or mathematical model) comprises equations (e.g., differential equa-
tions) or an equivalent set of information, which represents the system to some degree of
accuracy.
