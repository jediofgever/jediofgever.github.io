some information about areas of interest.<br>

<h1>My Notes</h1>
<h4>What is A dynamic system ?</h4>
A dynamic system is one whose response variables are functions of time, with non-negligible “rates” of changes. Also, its present
output depends not only on the present input, but also on some historical information
(e.g., previous input or output)

<h4>An analytical model ?</h4>
An analytical model (or mathematical model) comprises equations (e.g., differential equa-
tions) or an equivalent set of information, which represents the system to some degree of
accuracy.

<h4>How to represent mechatronic model ?</h4>

we represent the system with a model, such as a state space model, a linear graph, a bond graph, a transfer function model or a frequency-domain
model.

<h4>Mechatronics Model ?</h4>
In general, models may be grouped into the following categories:<br>
1.Physical models (prototypes)<br>
2.Analytical models<br>
3.Computer (numerical) models<br>
4.Experimental models (using input/output experimental data).
