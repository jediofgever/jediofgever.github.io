<h4>What is A dynamic system ?</h4>
A dynamic system is one whose response variables are functions of time, with non-negligible “rates” of changes. Also, its present
output depends not only on the present input, but also on some historical information
(e.g., previous input or output)

<h4>An analytical model ?</h4>
An analytical model (or mathematical model) comprises equations (e.g., differential equa-
tions) or an equivalent set of information, which represents the system to some degree of
accuracy.

<h4>How to represent mechatronic model ?</h4>

we represent the system with a model, such as a state space model, a linear graph, a bond graph, a transfer function model or a frequency-domain
model.

<h4>Mechatronic Models ?</h4>
In general, models may be grouped into the following categories:<br>
<br>
1.Physical models (prototypes)<br>
2.Analytical models<br>
3.Computer (numerical) models<br>
4.Experimental models (using input/output experimental data).

<h4> Controlling a system</h4>
A recommended way to control a dynamic
system is through the use of a suitable model of the system.

<h4>Mechanical Elements</h4>
<h5>Mass(inertia) Element</h5>
The constitutive equation (Newton’s second law) is<br>
m*dv/dt= f<br>

A finite force cannot cause an infinite acceleration in an inertia element. A finite
instantaneous change (step) in velocity will need an infinite force. Hence, v is a
natural output (or state) variable and f is a natural input variable for an inertia
element

<h5>Spring (Stiffness) Element</h5>
The constitutive equation (Hooke’s law) is
df/dt= k*v
Force can represent the state of a stiffness (spring) element. This is justified
because the force of a spring at any general time t may be completely determined
with the knowledge of the initial force and the applied velocity, and also because
the energy of a spring element can be represented in terms of f alone.

<h4>Core Properties of State-Space Rep.</h4>
<h5>Property1</h5>
The state vector x(t0) at time t0 and the input (forcing excitation) u[t0 , t1 ] over the time
interval [t0 , t1], will uniquely determine the state vector x(t1) any future time t1 . In other
words, a transformation g can be defined such that;
x(t1) = g(t0 , t1 , x(t0), u[t0 , t1])
<h5>Property2</h5>
The state x(t1) and the input u(t1) at any time t1 will uniquely determine the system output
or response vector y(t1) at that time. This can be expressed as <br>
y(t1) = h(t1 , x(t1), u(t1))<br>

This says that the system response (output) at time t1 depends on <strong> the time, the input,
and the state vector</strong>.
